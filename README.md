# UndergradCode
  Here I will be adding course related projects and homeworks throughout my undergrad as a Computer Science major at Southern Conn. State University.
Each code file will have a comment explaining what the code does.
This is just to showcase my learning experience with python currently and from classes including
CSC152- Intro to Programming
CSC212- Data Structures
CSC207- Computer Systems
I will be adding front end development projects in the future as I self teach myself the various languages of HTML,CSS,JS,and React.JS as my end goal is to be a front end SWE.
Thank you for checking out my progress!
